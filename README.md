A common way to display maps on computers, especially on the internet, is to use so called _tiled_ maps. A tiled map means that what appears to the user as one large map image, is really put together from a number of smaller images, _tiles_, that are drawn next to each other, without seams, to create the illusion of a much larger image.

Google Maps is most certainly the prime example of a tiled map. It made maps on the internet popular in 2005, by stitching together 256 by 256 pixel images of the whole world at remarkable detail. Today, almost all maps on the internet aimed to the public use tiling.
