A common way to display maps on computers, especially on the internet, is to use so called _tiled_ maps. A tiled map means that what appears to the user as one large map image, is really put together from a number of smaller images, _tiles_, that are drawn next to each other, without seams, to create the illusion of a much larger image.

[Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/) is most certainly the prime example of a tiled map. It made maps on the internet popular in 2005, by stitching together 256 by 256 pixel images of the whole world at remarkable detail. Today, almost all maps on the internet aimed to the public use tiling.

## Why tiled maps?

A paper map is a rectangular piece of paper, on which the map has been printed, with a map projection and scale that has been chosen by the cartographer to best suite the needs of the intended audience for the map. The paper's dimensions will impose limits on the amount of detail that can practically be shown on on the map: to allow more detail, the scale of the map will either have to be lowered, showing a smaller area of the world, or the paper will have to be enlarged. For real world printed maps, for example an atlas, the paper size cannot easily be changed, and instead a large number of maps with varying scale are created and together give overview maps as well as reasonably detailed maps of smaller portions of the world.

The most straight forward digital equivalent would be a single image of fixed dimension, possibly just a scanned paper map.
